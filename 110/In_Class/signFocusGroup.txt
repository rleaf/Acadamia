1. Julius: There is no objective difference in the message conveyed between the two images

2. Professor Marsh: 1st one = gestural. second one = impact. Potentially add dotted lines to the second one to indicate more 'gesture'

      Impact: Shows both illustrations, but does not emphasize the actual movement.
